# 🗡️ 180-Day GitHub Challenge: July 4 – Dec 31, 2025

Welcome to my personal **180-Day Coding Challenge**, running from **July 4th, 2025 to December 31st, 2025.**

This is my commitment to consistency, craftsmanship, and growth as a developer — with **at least 4–6 meaningful commits every single day**.  
No excuses. No shortcuts. Only progress.

---

## 🎯 What is this?

For the next **180 consecutive days**, I will:

✅ Push a minimum of **4–6 meaningful commits every day**  
✅ Work primarily on my **flagship project: `nInjaOS`**, a custom operating system written in Rust, with:  
- MacOS-like GUI  
- Kali Linux-inspired CLI terminal  
- GNOME-like workspace & window manager  
- Installer wizard  
- Custom apps (browser, notes, file manager, etc.)  

✅ Occasionally publish small side projects, tools, and experiments to complement the journey.

---

## 🚀 Why this challenge?

I believe skill grows with **deliberate, consistent practice** — and this streak is my way of proving that.  
This challenge also builds my public portfolio, contribution graph, and reputation as a disciplined builder.

## 🖥️ Current Main Project: `nInjaOS`

You can follow progress on [`nInjaOS`](https://github.com/AaYuSh11233/nInjaOS.git) — my fully custom operating system written in Rust.

Planned features:
- [x] Bootloader with glowing logo animation
- [x] Installer wizard with email validation
- [ ] MacOS-style GUI
- [ ] GNOME-like workspace and panels
- [ ] Fully-featured terminal with Linux commands and Windows passthrough
- [ ] Core apps: Notes, Browser, File Manager, Settings

I’ll be iteratively improving it every day during this challenge.

## 📦 Daily Commit Targets

✅ 4–6 meaningful commits/day  
✅ No filler commits — each one must improve code quality, add features, or improve documentation.

Examples of commit types:
- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation improvements
- `refactor:` Code clean-up and improvements
- `test:` Adding or fixing tests
- `style:` UI/UX polish

## 💡 Why public?

Sharing this publicly holds me accountable — and maybe inspires others to take on their own challenge.

You can track my streak on [GitHub Contributions](https://github.com/AaYuSh11233).

## ✨ Follow the Journey

I’ll post updates on my GitHub and (optionally) on social media as milestones are hit.

If you have suggestions, feedback, or just want to say hi — feel free to open an issue or connect!
